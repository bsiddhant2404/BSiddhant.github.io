# PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

# ABOUT 
This is my personal portfolio website. I have created it from scrap using HTML, HTML5, CSS and CSS3. 
It has four pages namely 'HOME', 'ABOUT', 'CONTACT' and 'RESUME'.
Presently I have closed the resume link for public due to privacy reasons.
It is requested that you open the website on your desktop or laptop. Presently this website is not fully operational for mobile screens.

# BUILD UP
This website makes extensive use of HTML tags for the basic functioning and features. 
It is styled with the help of an external CSS file.
The CSS file handles fixed backgroud images, background colours, buttons' styling and other entities like links, mouse hover and transition time.
